## Overview

As a user, I want to have an application that looks good, is easy to use, and is updated often, so that I want to come back and use it frequently.

Working from the provided comp images, write CSS such that the browser rendering matches the images as closely as possible.
Utilize the icon fonts located in styles/icons.css for navigation features as shown in the comp images.
As a developer, I want to use standard industry practices for setting up and organizing the code that handles the styling of my application so that my code is easy to edit and maintain.

Utilize a normalize.css file, which should be placed in a vendor/styles/ directory, to override default browser settings that affect the way documents render.
Utilize SMACSS practices to organize CSS into separate files and appropriately order the loading of those files in the <head> of the HTML document.
As a user, I want a familiar experience of the application so that I know how to use it on my smartphone and occasionally my laptop.

Initially design the application to render per the comp images on mobile devices.
Set up the viewport and fluid media rules so content renders per the comp images in both mobile and desktop views. Use a breakpoint of 640 pixels.
Add a "Hamburger" menu button that reveals the nav links when hovered over.
Ensure that images are responsive and do not exceed the size of the viewport.
